# Portfolio Project 3 - Electric Car Survey README
## 1. Purpose of the project

This project creates an application for the collection and recording of survey information relating to electric cars through a presentation of survey questions, a choice of answers, and input fields to enter the participants' chosen answers. The purpose of the survey is to gain insight into the participants' attitudes toward electric cars including the advantages and disadvantages they perceive regarding the technology. This information would be of use in a number of fields.

Firstly, it could be used in by those working in government and the public service to inform policy. For example, if a government has made the key decision to promote the purchasing of electric cars, the information collected may help identify the financial, educational, or other key points that would need to be addressed by such a public policy and its promotion.

Information gathered may also be of some use to those involved in the design and manufacture of electric cars. As an example, if it was determined that cost was a key factor, the industry could look at the manufacture of smaller, cheaper, car models.

Finally, the information could be useful in the advertising and sale of electric vehicles. For example, if vehicle range was an issue of concern, then advertising and promotion could focus in on the real world ranges now achieved by the cars and the actual real-world driving distances generally required by most drivers. The perceptions and the reality may not match and the advertising could address this, if this was found to be the case as a result of the survey.

In addition to the above, it should be noted that the application has been designed so that it is easy to reduce or extend the number of questions or change the questions and answers via the google sheet containing the data. Therefore, in addition to conducting this specific survey, this application can quiet easily be adapted to the rolling out of a survey on any topic via the editing of the google sheet containing the questions and possible answers.
